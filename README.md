# To Run
 Script main.py should be stored in the working directory along with
 the desired test file. Run the learner by executing the script with
 4 arguments in the order:
 
 <number of states> <number of possible actions> <test file> <discount factor>
 
 EX: "python main.py 5 3 test.in 0.9"
 
 Script execution will output error message if more or less than 4 arguments
 are given in the command line invocation.
